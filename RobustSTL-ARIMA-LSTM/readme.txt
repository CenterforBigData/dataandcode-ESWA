In the course of our research, we employed various methods and tools to construct predictive models. The ARIMA model was determined using the auto.arima() function in the R programming language, while the LSTM model was developed using the Keras library in Python, along with manual scripting. It is worth noting that specific parameter configurations may require adjustments based on the characteristics of individual datasets to achieve optimal performance.

Furthermore, the RobustSTL method was implemented using open-source code developed by Wen et al. (2019). For the STL method, we utilized the built-in functions of the Statsmodels package in Python, and for the STR method, we utilized R language's built-in packages. Regarding ensemble techniques, we opted for a straightforward additive ensemble approach.

We believe that readers can gain a deeper understanding of our research by accessing and combining these codes themselves. By manually combining these diverse models, readers can gain firsthand experience of their interactions and grasp their respective strengths and weaknesses in specific contexts. This approach facilitates a more profound comprehension of our research motivations and outcomes, offering abundant inspiration and insights for their own studies.
